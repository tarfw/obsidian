# Mollie — Style Reference
> cashmere counter, dark ledger. Keep broad white editorial space around black type, then anchor product moments in warm cream, espresso-brown, and tactile real-world payment photography.

**Theme:** light

Source measurements are normalized; roles and recommendations are interpreted. Font summary lists are independent, not paired by position. HTML examples are reconstructions, not source components.

Mollie is a white-canvas payments site built around oversized, tightly tracked black typography and photographic proof points. The page alternates quiet editorial space with contained product and customer imagery; warm cream cards, dark espresso product panels, and a restrained burnt-orange link accent interrupt the monochrome foundation. Inter’s low-weight display scale keeps large statements open and direct, while IBM Plex Mono uppercase labels provide a compact operational layer above products, media, and categories.

### Layout

- **Section gap:** 32px
- **Card padding:** 40px
- **Element gap:** 10px

## Components

### Public Navigation Bar
**Role:** Top-level site navigation

A 54px-high Paper bar with the wordmark at left, 14px/500 Inter navigation links at 18.2px line-height and -0.32px tracking, and a Ledger Brown 9999px sign-up pill at right.

### Display Hero
**Role:** Primary landing-page introduction

Use an Ink Inter Variable display at 82px/400 with 82px line-height and -2.4px tracking. Pair it with a 16px/400 supporting paragraph at 20.8px line-height and -0.4px tracking; place the content above a wide 16px-radius photo or payment demonstration.

### Monospace Eyebrow
**Role:** Section and product category label

IBM Plex Mono 13px/500 uppercase text at 16.9px line-height; use Ink on light surfaces. Smaller media labels use IBM Plex Mono 11px/400, uppercase, 11px line-height, and +0.11px tracking in Paper.

### Ledger Brown Pill Button
**Role:** Filled public conversion control

Ledger Brown #3b281d background, Paper label, 9999px radius, and 16px 24px padding. Set the label in Inter 16px/500 with 19.2px line-height and -0.2px tracking; retain the subtle inset top highlight of rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.08) 0 1px 0.

### Oat Surface Pill Button
**Role:** Secondary public conversion control

Oat Surface #f7f4f1 background with Ink text, 9999px radius, and 16px 24px padding. Use Inter 16px/500 at 19.2px line-height and -0.2px tracking.

### Product Category Cell
**Role:** Payment capability navigation

A Paper grid cell with a fine #f7f4f1 separator and 22px padding on all sides. Pair a small monochrome line icon with compact Ink text; assemble as two rows of five equal cells inside a lightly rounded 16px outer frame.

### Cream Product Feature Card
**Role:** Product pathway teaser

Use Oat Surface #f7f4f1, 16px radius, no shadow, and 40px top padding. Lead with an IBM Plex Mono uppercase category label, then an Ink product title and a Copper Link #e07122 inline link; reserve the lower card area for product imagery.

### Espresso Product Demo Card
**Role:** Product-interface showcase

Use Espresso Panel #211006 with a 16px radius and no shadow. Set interface chrome, transactional data, and small controls in Paper; treat the dark panel as a contained demo surface, not a page-wide dark theme.

### Hero Media Frame
**Role:** Payment photography and media carousel

Use natural-color payment photography in a contained 16px-radius frame. Overlay small Paper or translucent dark controls without adding external drop shadows; dark media can carry IBM Plex Mono 11px uppercase labels.

### Payment Approval Toast
**Role:** In-media transactional confirmation

Place a compact rounded dark overlay over imagery with a small outlined approval icon and Paper text. Keep it visually secondary to the photo and use the same dark espresso family as product-demo surfaces.

### Customer Story Carousel Card
**Role:** Customer proof and testimonial module

Pair a contained 16px-radius customer photo with a centered brand mark and an Adamina 16px/400 testimonial at 20.8px line-height. Use isolated circular arrow controls with 28px radius over media.

### Status Label
**Role:** Embedded product-state indicator

Use Active Green #1e681d for active states, Pending Ochre #8b6900 for setup or forthcoming states, and Expiry Red #99001c for expired states. Keep labels compact and pair status text with an optional Active Green Surface #288a26 dot.

### Terracotta Graphic Disc
**Role:** Decorative card graphic

Use a #d66733 circular surface with a 50% radius and no shadow. Restrict it to large isolated visual punctuation within cards or illustrations.

## Do's and Don'ts

### Do
- Use Paper #ffffff as the dominant canvas and reserve Oat Surface #f7f4f1 for contained cards and secondary pill controls.
- Set display headlines in Inter Variable 82px/400, 82px line-height, and -2.4px tracking.
- Use IBM Plex Mono uppercase labels at 13px/500 with 16.9px line-height above product and media content.
- Use Ledger Brown #3b281d only for filled public pill buttons with 9999px radius and 16px 24px padding.
- Give product cards and media frames a 16px radius; use 24px only for larger image and media treatments.
- Use Copper Link #e07122 for inline product-card links and small commerce-oriented highlights.
- Keep the default page rhythm on the 4px base unit, using 10px element gaps and 32px section gaps.

### Don't
- Do not use blue #0040ff or browser-default #0000ee as a brand or button color.
- Do not turn the Ledger Brown #3b281d filled treatment into a square button; public conversion controls use 9999px radius.
- Do not use heavy outer drop shadows on cards; cards use no shadow and rely on Oat Surface #f7f4f1, borders, and rounded media.
- Do not use bold 600-700 weights for the 82px display role; retain Inter Variable 400.
- Do not replace IBM Plex Mono uppercase labels with Inter body text.
- Do not apply Terracotta Disc #d66733 as a broad page background or universal action color.
- Do not use status colors outside compact payment and account-state contexts.

## Surfaces

| Level | Name | Value | Purpose |
|-------|------|-------|---------|
| 0 | Paper | `#ffffff` | Primary page canvas, header, grid cells, and light content fields. |
| 1 | Oat Surface | `#f7f4f1` | Feature cards, pale controls, thin surface outlines, and soft sectional contrast. |
| 2 | Ledger Brown | `#3b281d` | Filled public controls and compact dark navigation affordances. |
| 3 | Espresso Panel | `#211006` | Contained product demonstrations and dark transactional media. |

## Elevation

Avoid floating-card elevation. Light surfaces separate through Oat Surface fills, 16px corners, and occasional 1px #f5f2f0 outlines; dark buttons use a faint inset white highlight rather than a cast shadow.

## Imagery

Photography is central and product-adjacent: hands using phones, countertop terminals, retail environments, and customer scenes are shown as warm, natural-color crops rather than stock-office portraits. Images are wide, contained, and softly rounded at 16px, with occasional dark translucent payment overlays or circular arrow controls placed directly on the image. The page is text-led between media moments, while customer logos and sparse monochrome line icons provide the non-photographic visual layer. Dark product demonstrations use realistic interface fragments, data, and device screens as explanatory content rather than abstract fintech decoration.

## Layout

The page is a white, full-bleed editorial composition with a fixed-height top navigation bar and generous unruled white space around the opening message. The hero uses a wide text composition: an oversized left-aligned headline, a narrower explanatory and conversion block to the right, then a broad contained payment photograph with 16px corners. Product content moves through a dark horizontal media selector, a centered customer-logo strip, and a two-row five-column payment-capability grid before splitting into paired cream feature cards. Customer stories use a wide three-panel horizontal carousel with image-first cards and centered quote text below, followed by large dark product-media sections; the footer returns to a dense multi-link structure.
